/**
 * Remembers where drawing was going, so a render pass can put it back.
 *
 * <p>The rule this exists to enforce: a pass that binds its own render target must restore
 * <em>whatever was bound before</em>, never {@code Minecraft.getMainRenderTarget()}. Those two are
 * the same thing only while the game window is the only place a frame can land, and that assumption
 * is wrong in two situations that both already exist:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a UI drawn into an off-screen target — an element with {@code overflow: hidden} or an opacity
 *       below one renders through {@link com.lowdragmc.lowdraglib2.gui.ui.rendering.UIVisualLayer},
 *       and a scene or effect drawn inside it would escape into the game's frame;</li>
 *   <li>a UI hosted in its own operating-system window, where the main target is a different window
 *       entirely and anything restored to it is simply drawn somewhere the user is not looking.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Usage is a try-with-resources around the pass:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * try (var ignored = RenderTargetScope.capture()) {
 *     myTarget.bindWrite(true);
 *     ...
 * } // previous framebuffer and viewport are back
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Both values come from {@code GlStateManager}'s own mirrors rather than {@code glGetIntegerv},
 * so capturing costs nothing and never stalls the pipeline.
