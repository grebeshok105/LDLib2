/**
 * Decides, for a piece of text about to be drawn, whether its glyphs come from the scalable distance field
 * atlas or from an atlas rasterized at the size it is actually being drawn at.
 * <p>
 * A distance field describes an outline, not pixels. It scales and rotates for free, but it has no hinting, so
 * a one pixel stem landing between two device pixels correctly becomes two grey pixels rather than one solid
 * one. Rasterizing at the exact size lets FreeType's hinting snap that stem onto the grid instead, which is
 * what every desktop UI toolkit does and why their text looks crisper.
 * <p>
 * The catch is that a rasterized size only serves that size. Anything that changes size every frame would
 * re-bake the whole alphabet every frame, so this class deliberately refuses to open new sizes when they are
 * arriving quickly, and such text falls back to the distance field, which is exactly the case the distance
 * field is good at.
 * <p>
 * The selected bucket is read by {@link LDFontSet#getGlyph} while text is being emitted. It is plain static
 * state because all of this happens on the render thread inside a single draw call.
