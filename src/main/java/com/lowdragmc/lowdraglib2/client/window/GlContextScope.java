/**
 * Makes another GL context current for the length of a try-with-resources block, and puts the
 * previous one back.
 *
 * <p><b>This is the only place in the library that may call {@code glfwMakeContextCurrent}</b>, and
 * the rule that goes with it is absolute: no {@code RenderSystem} or {@code GlStateManager} call may
 * happen inside the scope. Those classes keep static Java-side mirrors of GL state, and those
 * mirrors describe Minecraft's context. GL state is per-context, so touching the other context
 * directly leaves Minecraft's mirrors correct — but routing a call through {@code RenderSystem}
 * while the other context is current corrupts them, and nothing detects it:
 * {@code RenderSystem.assertOnRenderThread} only checks the thread, and the thread is right.
 *
 * <p>Two subtleties that look like they can be skipped and cannot:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>LWJGL caches {@link GLCapabilities} per thread, not per context. Both contexts are current
 *       on the same thread at different times, so the cache does not follow the switch and has to be
 *       swapped by hand. With a single graphics driver the two capability objects happen to be
 *       interchangeable and skipping this appears to work; on a machine with two it can crash.</li>
 *   <li>Objects written in one context are only guaranteed visible to another after the writer
 *       flushes, hence the {@link GL11C#glFlush()} before the switch.</li>
 * </ul>
