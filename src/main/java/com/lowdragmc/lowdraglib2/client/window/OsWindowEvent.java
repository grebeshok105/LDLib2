/**
 * A raw GLFW callback, recorded rather than acted on.
 *
 * <p>Callbacks for a second window fire from inside {@code glfwPollEvents}, which Minecraft calls
 * from two places that are both bad times to run UI logic: the middle of
 * {@code RenderSystem.flipFrame}, between the buffer swap and the next frame; and inside
 * {@code RenderSystem.limitDisplayFPS}, where the game is deliberately idling in
 * {@code glfwWaitEventsTimeout}. On Windows there is a third — while the user drags or resizes a
 * decorated window, the platform runs a nested modal message loop inside that same poll.
 *
 * <p>So the callbacks only enqueue, and the host drains the queue at one defined point per frame,
 * immediately before it renders. That ordering also happens to be the one the UI requires: nothing
 * on {@code ModularUIWidget} hit-tests, so the hovered element has to be resolved before any pointer
 * event is dispatched.
