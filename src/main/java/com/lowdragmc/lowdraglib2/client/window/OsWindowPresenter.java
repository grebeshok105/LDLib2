/**
 * Puts a texture rendered in Minecraft's context onto a second window's screen.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately the smallest thing that can work: one framebuffer object, one
 * {@code glBlitFramebuffer}, one swap. No shader, no vertex array, no vertex data — which matters
 * because everything here runs with the other context current, where {@code RenderSystem} is
 * off-limits (see {@link GlContextScope}) and a forward-compatible core profile has no default
 * vertex array object to fall back on.
 *
 * <p>Textures are shared between the two contexts; framebuffer objects are <em>not</em>, so the FBO
 * has to be created here rather than reused from Minecraft's side.
 *
 * <p>No vertical flip. The source texture and the window's default framebuffer are both bottom-up,
 * which is also why {@code RenderTarget#blitToScreen} does not flip either.
