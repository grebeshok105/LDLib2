/**
 * An editor pane torn off into its own operating-system window.
 *
 * <p>Everything about being a window — moving, resizing, the pointer shapes, keeping the parent's
 * theme — comes from {@link ModularUIWindow} and is available to any LDLib UI. What is added here is
 * only the dock behaviour: the window's contents are a real {@link SplittableWindow} tree, so tabs,
 * splitting and dragging a tab between this window's own panes all work with the code that already
 * does that in the editor.
 *
 * <p>What is deliberately <em>not</em> supported is dragging a tab between windows — GLFW gives no
 * cross-window drag, and faking it needs global cursor tracking and hit-testing against every window,
 * so floating and docking back are menu-driven instead.
