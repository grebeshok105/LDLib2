/**
 * Where the debugger window was last left: its size, its position, and whether it was pinned above
 * the other windows.
 *
 * <p>Remembered because the debugger is opened and closed constantly — that is what it is for — and
 * a tool that reverts to a default rectangle in the middle of the screen every time has to be
 * re-arranged every time. Kept across game sessions as well as across closes, in one small NBT file
 * next to the editor's own saved layouts, for the same reason.
 *
 * <p>The maximized state is deliberately <em>not</em> remembered. {@code glfwMaximizeWindow} is
 * {@code ShowWindow(SW_MAXIMIZE)} on Win32, which activates the window — restoring it on open would
 * make the debugger steal the keyboard, and would do so from inside an automated run's frame hook.
 * Restoring the pre-maximize rectangle is what "restore" means anyway.
 *
 * @param x          window position, or {@link #UNPLACED} to let the platform decide
 * @param alwaysOnTop whether the window was pinned above the others
