/**
 * Corrects the scissor box for a UI that is not being drawn into the game window.
 *
 * <p>{@code GuiGraphics#applyScissor} turns a gui-space rectangle into a GL scissor box by scaling
 * it by the gui scale and flipping it against the framebuffer height — and it reads both of those
 * from {@link net.minecraft.client.Minecraft#getWindow()}, unconditionally. Drawing into an
 * off-screen target of a different size therefore clips at the wrong place, which shows up as every
 * {@code overflow: hidden} element being cut off vertically.
 *
 * <p>The fix is deliberately additive: {@link GUIContext} still lets {@code GuiGraphics} manage the
 * scissor stack — so nested vanilla scissors keep intersecting correctly — and then re-issues the GL
 * call with the right numbers. On the game window this is a no-op after one boolean check, so the
 * on-screen path is untouched.
