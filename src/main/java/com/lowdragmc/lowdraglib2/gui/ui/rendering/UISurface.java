/**
 * The destination a UI frame is drawn into: its framebuffer, its gui scale and its OS window.
 *
 * <p>Until this existed, everything read {@link Minecraft#getWindow()} and
 * {@link Minecraft#getMainRenderTarget()} directly, which is correct exactly as long as there is one
 * place a UI can appear. {@link #main()} is still the default and still resolves to those, so
 * nothing changes for an on-screen UI; the point is that a UI can now be rendered into an off-screen
 * target of a different size.
 *
 * <p>Two consumers depend on this and are easy to miss:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the scissor box, which is computed by flipping the rect against the framebuffer height —
 *       get the height wrong and every clip in the frame is vertically offset;</li>
 *   <li>{@link UIVisualLayer}, which allocates its targets at the destination's size.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>{@link #current()} exists for the draw code that only ever receives a
 * {@link net.minecraft.client.gui.GuiGraphics} — {@link com.lowdragmc.lowdraglib2.gui.texture.IGuiTexture}
 * implementations — and so cannot be handed the surface explicitly.
