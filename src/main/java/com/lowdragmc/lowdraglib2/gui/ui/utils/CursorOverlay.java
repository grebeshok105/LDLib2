/**
 * Draws a stand-in pointer wherever {@link CursorState} says the cursor is.
 *
 * <p>A synthetic cursor is invisible by construction: the arrow on screen is drawn by the operating
 * system at the <em>physical</em> pointer, which is exactly the thing a background run stops moving.
 * Without this, watching a run means guessing where it thinks it is clicking.
 *
 * <p>Drawn from {@code ScreenEvent.Render.Post}, so it sits above the screen and its tooltips, and
 * only while a screen is open — with no screen there is nothing to point at.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately absent from screenshots: a real cursor is composited by the window manager and
 * never reaches the framebuffer, so a capture that contained one would differ from every capture
 * taken before this existed, and would put an arrow through element crops. The runner hides it for
 * the frame it is about to read; where a step aimed is recorded in the report instead.
