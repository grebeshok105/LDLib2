 *
 * <p>The sibling of {@link KeyState}, and it exists for the same reason. The only way to move the
 * pointer from inside the process is {@code glfwSetCursorPos}, which moves the pointer of whoever is
 * sitting at the machine, and which GLFW ignores entirely while the window is unfocused. Automation
 * built on it can therefore only run in the foreground of an idle machine. With this seam the
 * position is simply reported, so a run needs neither focus nor the user's mouse.
 *
 * <p>This describes the <em>game</em> window only. A UI hosted in its own OS window reads that
 * window's own cursor through {@code OsWindow}, and is unaffected.
