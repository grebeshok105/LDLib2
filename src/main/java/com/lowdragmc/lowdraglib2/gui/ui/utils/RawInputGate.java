/**
 * Whether input the operating system delivers to the game window reaches the game at all.
 *
 * <p>Vanilla's {@code MouseHandler#onMove/onPress/onScroll} and
 * {@code KeyboardHandler#keyPress/charTyped} have no {@code isWindowActive()} guard, so a click on
 * an <em>unfocused</em> game window is both focused and delivered by the platform. On a machine
 * someone is using while a scripted run drives that window, one stray click lands in the middle of
 * the run.
 *
 * <p>Kept separate from {@link CursorState} on purpose: a scripted playback wants a synthetic
 * pointer while still letting whoever is watching interrupt it. Only an unattended run wants both.
 *
 * <p>The window's close button is unaffected — it arrives through {@code glfwWindowShouldClose}
 * rather than these callbacks — so a blocked game can still be quit.
