/**
 * The thresholds that decide whether graph content draws in full, as flat silhouettes, or as plain
 * blocks of colour. Everything downstream of {@link GraphView#getLod()} is draw-path only and needs a
 * client, but the decision itself is pure and worth pinning: an off-by-one in the comparisons would
 * either disable LOD entirely or strip detail that was still perfectly readable.
 *
 * <p>The unit is <b>physical screen pixels per UI unit</b>, not canvas zoom. There is no GUI scale on
 * a game-test server, so {@link GraphView#getPixelScale()} degrades to the raw zoom here and the two
 * happen to coincide; the pixel-scale cases below go through {@link GraphView#resolveLod} directly so
 * they stay meaningful either way.
