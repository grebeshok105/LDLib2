/**
 * {@link InputMode#REAL}: move the OS cursor and let Minecraft's own {@code MouseHandler} deliver
 * the movement on the next frame, instead of refreshing the hover directly.
 *
 * <p>Worth the frame coupling when a scenario needs code that reads GLFW rather than the event to
 * behave — {@code ModularUI#onFilesDrop} queries {@code glfwGetCursorPos} directly, for instance.
 * The runner gives every step its own frame anyway, so gesture expansion is identical in both modes.
 *
 * <p>Note this mode does <em>not</em> change what modifier keys report: {@code glfwGetKey} reads the
 * physical keyboard and nothing inside the process can move it. Modifier-sensitive behaviour is
 * covered by {@link com.lowdragmc.lowdraglib2.gui.ui.utils.KeyState}, which the runner overrides for
 * the duration of a run in either mode.
 *
 * <p><b>Foreground only.</b> This is the one mode that moves the pointer of whoever is at the
 * machine and needs the game window focused — GLFW delivers cursor callbacks to no other window, and
 * ignores {@code glfwSetCursorPos} on an unfocused one. Every other mode runs happily in the
 * background; see {@link com.lowdragmc.lowdraglib2.gui.ui.utils.CursorState}.
