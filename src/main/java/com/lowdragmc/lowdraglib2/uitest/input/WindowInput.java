/**
 * Drives a UI hosted in its own operating-system window.
 *
 * <p>{@link InputDriver} cannot reach one: every mode it has ends at
 * {@code Minecraft.getInstance().screen}, and a {@link ModularUIWindow} has no screen — it takes its
 * input from raw GLFW callbacks queued on its own window. So this posts into that same queue, which
 * is what makes it a test of the window's real dispatch path rather than a way around it: the events
 * are drained, hit-tested and dispatched by exactly the code a physical click goes through, including
 * the move/resize gesture handling that decides whether the UI sees a press at all.
 *
 * <p>Coordinates are the window's own GUI-scaled space — which is what {@link ElementBounds} reports
 * for elements in that window's UI, and is <em>not</em> the game window's space even when the two
 * share a gui scale, because the window has its own size.
 *
 * <p>Post one primitive per scenario step, as with {@link InputDriver}. The queue is drained once per
 * frame, so several primitives posted together are all dispatched against the same layout and the
 * same hover, and any gesture that depends on a frame passing in between — a drag — will not start.
